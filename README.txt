This project is aimed at continuous monitoring of water quality in the water sources. There are many reasons for the water contamination these days and this water is being out-sourced as drinking water for people. This is leading to many diseases and other effects towards the people consuming it. Not everyone can afford RO water and at sometime or the other everyone depends upon these water sources. So monitoring the purity of this water source is necessary now. Municipal authorities that send the water for households and other purposes are the one who can take care of this contamination and this project is to guide them for achieving drinking water purity.

This project contains sensors that can sense turbidity, ph, temperature, dissolved oxygen. These sensors send the real time data to the municipal office continuously and a graph is plotted for the obtained values. When the graph crosses a certain margin where contamination cannot be tolerated further, it shows an alert that the water is more contaminated and this water should not be sent for household chores. Municipal authorities can take the required action that if Ph is less, one action is taken and if turbidity is more, other action is taken. There are certain procedures to achieve this. One such procedure is connecting the sensors to the arduino UNO and uploading it to Thinkspeak cloud for analysis. 

In this project, we build the code for connecting the sensors and collecting the data. These codes are made into a package (library) in arduino and are contributed to the open source environment. This project can be further extended in terms of security while sending this data to the cloud and also the data loss that occurs in between. 

On analyzing this data further, we can get the information about the water quality in different times of a year. For example: In summer season, temperature of the water becomes high (Fact though). The same kind of statistics can be derived for the other components. Using this data, it would be easy for the maintenance people to mix sufficient purifiers in those times.
